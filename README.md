# Introduction

This is a utility library with some very subjective helper functions for the awesome [JUCE](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) cross-platform C++ programming framework.

## Usage

This repository is meant to be included as a git submodule in a main project, see for instance [JammerNetz](https://github.com/christofmuc/JammerNetz) for an example how this is used.
In order to build this library standalone, which is what the CI server should be doing, there is a separate little repository that you can use.

For what is in this library, please use the header files to see the utility functions, I am busy with my main projects and can't add more documentation right now.

## Contributing

All pull requests and issues welcome, I will try to get back to you as soon as I can.

## About the author

Christof is a lifelong software developer having worked in various industries, and can't stop his programming hobby anyway.
